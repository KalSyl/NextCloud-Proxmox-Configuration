## Description

Below are the steps that I followed to get a NextCloud LXC set up and running on my Proxmox server. I have a NAS (TrueNas) already set up and configured, running on a VM inside Proxmox (it's a bad idea, so I wouldn't do this if I had the hardware to dedicate to the NAS). Functionally, it *should* work the same way regardless of where your NAS is mounted. 

## Setup

In Proxmox, click on your local stoarge in the left hand pane. Then click on CT Templates.
